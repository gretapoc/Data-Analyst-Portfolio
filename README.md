### An Examination of Social and Economic Data Across Nations Worldwide Using Statistical Analysis

**Full project:** [Published on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/Gretapoc/Socio-Economic-Analysis-of-Countries)

**Goal:** The objective is to examine the socio-economic data of countries worldwide, analyze their diversity by identifying similarities and differences, and apply relevant statistical methods to accurately classify the resulting groups.

**Description:** The presented dataset is thoroughly cleaned and organized, sourced from the 2019 World Bank databases. The dataset undergoes a comprehensive statistical analysis, utilizing an array of statistical methods such as principal component analysis, cluster analysis (both hierarchical and non-hierarchical), as well as hypothesis testing. 

**Skills:** Data analysis, data visualization

**Technology:** R

**Results:** Through the application of statistical methods, distinct clusters of countries were identified based on economic and social factors, and the geographic position of countries within each cluster played a role in their similarities and differences. Further analysis revealed outliers, including Chad and India, and hypotheses were tested to investigate gender differences in suicide rates and life expectancy.
